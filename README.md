# Data Analysis on Respiratory Data

## Validation of a prototype

After proposing a novel methodology for respiration monitoring (based on magnetic field variations), I had to validate it against an analogous commercially available sensor (piezoelectric, PZT, sensor), using a gold-standard (airflow transducer) as reference.

A set of 12 different activities were performed by healthy subjects, simultaneously wearing the 3 sensors.

## What we are trying to understand?

For the context of monitoring respiratory patterns, at this stage it would be enough to test the performance of the prototype in the representation of flow reversal (FR) events, aka the onset of **inspiration** and **expiration**. To characterize the prototype the main objectives were to answer the following questions:

**Q1:** What is the accuracy of detection of FR events in comparison to the PZT sensor?
**Q2:** Does the prototype have differential performance between inspiratory and expiratory events?
**Q3:** What are there limitations of the prototype (e.g. does it underperform in certain circumstances)?

## Exploring data
